# “IMAGE ANALYSIS APPLICATION & IMAGE INSIGHT USING GOOGLE’S CLOUD VISION API”

Abstract :

Image analysis is the extraction of meaningful information from images; mainly from digital images by means of digital image processing techniques. This Image Analysis Application helps by recognizing wide arrangements of articles in your pictures, from blooms, creatures, or transportation to a huge number of other question classes normally found inside pictures. Google cloud Vision API enhances after some time as new ideas are presented and precision is progressed. With API’s Vision, you can make custom models that features explicit ideas from your pictures. This empowers use cases running from arranging item pictures to diagnosing ailments. There are two modules one for scanning the picture and other for saving pictures.

Block diagram & Description: 










In this project, the user can capture any image using the raspberry pi camera module. The system will use Google Cloud Vision API to analyze the image and display its insights to the user. It can detect faces from the image and display their properties. It will show image details such as labels, landmarks and logos. 
It can also detect multiple objects from the image.  It can also show if the image is safe for a certain age group, whether it contains any violence or not and other details that may concern. The user will be able to view details about web entities only if the image was taken from any web sources, else it will ignore this. If the user wants, they can save the images. The list of all the saved images can be viewed by the user.

Image Details
Details of all the images can be found using Google Cloud Vision API.
Google cloud vision API can detect the image.
The system can detect faces and expressions from images.
It will display image properties to the user
It will add labels to the images.


Results (Model’s image): Results should have the image of the final device/model that was built by your group. Discussion about the same in few paragraphs. One or more images can be uploaded but unnecessary images will result in reduction of marks. 



The code is run using Python language. 


Challenges faced: 

We faced many challenges when it came to completing and executing this project. It was hard to gather information due to the very limited resources that were available to us on the net. The information that was already present on some sites were not entirely efficient. 
We also faced some problems in getting the camera module to work as it kept disconnecting from the raspberry pi module.
The code that we used was quite complex to put together as well since we were developing a code that was going to be detecting different analytics.
We also were able to put the project together only before the last week of submission which made us rush through the work despite the camera giving us a bit of trouble.
Another challenge we faced is that our project does not work without wifi. In areas of low network our project took quite a long amount of time to run the code.
